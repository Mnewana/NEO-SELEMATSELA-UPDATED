    <p>I am an Information technology and Computer Science graduate with a passion for technology. I have studied at South West Gauteng TVET College. Given the nature of my qualification in which is equivalent to matric (National Certificate Vocational, NQF level 4) does not provide lot of opportunity in the work place requirements. 

     <p>I have two year experience as an IT Technician/ Network administrator (Internship) at the said TVET College and also volunteering at the same college after the end of my contract, also worked part-time as a stock taker at Dial A Student Company.</p>
      
      Both job opportunities provided me with management skills and technical skills and work experience respectively and again, my studies in computer science taught me how to see things logically. Being considered for the position will allow me to extend my knowledge in the IT field.
      I am currently learning how develop software application for a portfolio. 
      <p>I'm also interested in other fields of, particularly Cybersecurity since it is in demand, also learning how to programm will help me if ever i end up in that field.</p>
